# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Im trying my best to keep the project safe, this will 
mainly apply to the main branch of the project since there
are currently no versions or something like that.
CodeQL is used for additional checking on github

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability you should open an issue on codeberg and 
tell me what the problem is and I will check what I can do.
I will regualirly update you on the progress of the vulnerability and write
if it is an accepted problem or there is something else that makes it 
already secure.
